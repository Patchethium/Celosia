# Celosia

**Fast and accurate phonemizer[^1], built in Rust**

</div>

`Celosia` (/siÀêÀàlo ä Éi…ô/ see-LOH-shee-…ô) is a Rust crate that turns a sentence of natural language into its phoneme transcript automatically. It supports English (amepd), Japanese (romaji), Mandarin (pinyin), French and German (prosodylab), with language-specific data (stress, accent and tones).

## Overview

This section briefly introduces the phonemization pipeline for each language.

#### English

1. Look up words in `amepd` for spelling and stress.
2. For words that have multiple spellings, use the POS tag provided by `amepd` and a `Averaged Perceptron Tagger` to disambiguate them.
3. For OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words, predict the spelling with a g2p[^2] model.

#### Japanese

1. Retrieve the full context label from the text with `openjtalk-rs`.
2. Parse the context label, retrieve accent phrases and their mora boundary information.
4. We ignore OOV words for the UTF code doesn't contain any information of spelling.

#### Mandarin Chinese

1. Segment text with `jieba-rs` into words.
2. Look up words in `CC-CEDICT` for pinyin and tones.
3. For words that have multiple spellings, use a CRF model to disambiguate them.
4. We ignore OOV words for the UTF code doesn't contain any information of spelling.

#### French & German

Thanks for the orthography, French & German generally don't have the disambiguation (i.e. one word, multiple spelling) problem that is commonly seen in the languages above.  

1. Look up words in `prosody-lab`'s dictionaries.
2. For OOVs, we predict the spelling with a g2p[^2] model.

### G2P

The `G2P` model we're using is a seq2seq transformer model, you can find more information in [the module](src/g2p).
